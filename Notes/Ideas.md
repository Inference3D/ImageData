# Thoughts about ImageDB #

I envision that the structure of the code will resemble something like:
* ImageDB: This will contain the main console application for commands.
* ImageDBLib: This will be the main library for queries and invoking operations
* ImageDBTest: The location where I will put the unit tests for ImageDBLib
* Operations will be a separate folder for holding operations that I will perform against the images.
